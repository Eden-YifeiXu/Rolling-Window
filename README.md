# Rolling-Window

Attached is a file(GOOG.csv) containing historical stock prices over a one-year period. With the data, compute a rolling window of statistics. Statistics would include the following:
<br>
  <p>Range: max - min</p>
  Mean: average</p>
  Median: 50th percentile</p>
  Standard Deviation: standard deviation</p>
  
Write a Python computer program to do the following:
<br>
  From the user, input the rolling window size. For instance, inputting 5 would yield a weekly window, while inputting a 20 is a monthly window, etc. Make sure that the input is           valid. For instance, if a user inputs 400, this would be impossible because not enough data exists.</p>
  Over the rolling window, compute statistics mentioned above.</p>
  plot the rolling statistics.</p>
