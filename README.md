# Rolling-Window

Attached is a file(GOOG.csv) containing historical stock prices over a one-year period. With the data, compute a rolling window of statistics. Statistics would include the following:
  >	Range: max - min
  >	Mean: average
  >	Median: 50th percentile
  >	Standard Deviation: standard deviation
  
Write a Python computer program to do the following:
  > From the user, input the rolling window size. For instance, inputting 5 would yield a weekly window, while inputting a 20 is a monthly window, etc. Make sure that the input is valid. For instance, if a user inputs 400, this would be impossible because not enough data exists.
  > Over the rolling window, compute statistics mentioned above.
  > plot the rolling statistics.
